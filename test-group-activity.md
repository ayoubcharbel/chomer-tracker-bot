### Step 1: Send Commands in Your Group
Go to your group and send these commands **one by one**:

1. **Send**: `/start`
   - ✅ Should show welcome message with point system
   
2. **Send**: `/help` 
   - ✅ Should show help information
   
3. **Send**: `/leaderboard`
   - ✅ Should show "No activity yet!" (if no messages tracked yet)

### Step 2: Send Regular Messages
1. **Send a few regular messages** in the group
2. **Send a sticker or two**
3. **Wait a few seconds**

### Step 3: Check Leaderboard  
1. **Send**: `/leaderboard` again
   - ✅ Should now show your activity!
   - ✅ Should show your points (1 per message, 1 per sticker)

2. **Send**: `/stats`
   - ✅ Should show your personal statistics

## 🔍 What to Look For:

**If Working Correctly:**
- `/start` responds with welcome message
- `/leaderboard` shows your messages and stickers
- `/stats` shows your personal points
- Points = messages + stickers (1 point each)

**If NOT Working:**
- No responses to commands
- Leaderboard stays empty
- No stats tracking
